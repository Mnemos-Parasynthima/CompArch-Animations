- Implement cache alongside pipeline
- Animate pipeline/PIPE with path highlights and data flow
- add testing lib to ensure correctness
- selib
	- currently, api functions work by passing `machine_t* guest` and `globals_t* globals`
	- better way is to pass the pipeline registers instead
		- need to "extract" them to their own pointers (`fetchReg = selib.getFetchPipe(guest)`)

- demonstrating ret and hlt for SEQ
	- check how to properly do it
- animation currently does not allow for looping
