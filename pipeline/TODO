Very ambitious plan:
- Very interactive
- Allow user to type an assembly program
  - Assembler (parser, lexer, etc)
- Write an actual pipeline (near-copy from SE lab)
  - Animations are to follow alongside program execution




Two animations:
  - Proceeding through the pipeline/stages
    - 
  - Show changes across pipeline regs
