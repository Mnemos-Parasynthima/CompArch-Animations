- Implement cache alongside pipeline
- Animate pipeline/PIPE with path highlights and data flow
- add testing lib to ensure correctness
- proper way to stop the execution
	- currently, stopping based on length of instructions and indexing
	- will not work when looping/branch is in place
	- need to use se's way of halting
- selib
	- currently, api functions work by passing `machine_t* guest` and `globals_t* globals`
	- better way is to pass the pipeline registers instead
		- need to "extract" them to their own pointers (`fetchReg = selib.getFetchPipe(guest)`)
